# Collections-in-java
Collection framework in java

Need of Collections in java:

Think of situation where we need to store 10000 values, we cannot go for variable declaration approach as it reduces readabilty and its not a good practice to declare more variables.

Hence we go for Array approach.In array we can store all the values by defining a single variable.

for example Employee emp[] = new Employee[10000]; this works well as the size is defined initially.But what happens if we need to store more than 10000????

There are some limitations in Arrays:

1.The size should be known in prior.
2.Only Homogeneous data elements allowed in arrays.
3.Underlying data structure in not in arrays

Point 2----Homogeneous data element means emp[0] = new Employee(); -> this is valid.

But emp[1] = new Customer();this is invalid -> compiler throws an error stating incompatible type.

But this above problem can be solved by using Object arrays.

Object obj[] = new Object();

Now we can add heterogenous data elements to obj.
obj[0] = new Employee();   -> valid.
obj[1] = new Customer();   -> valid.

Point 3--- Underlying Data structure.

In array if we need to search anything we need to write the code manually to search it or if we need to sort the data then we need to 
write the program for searching as well.(no readymade method support)

but this is not the case in collections.

Collections have some built in functions to do these operations like contains().

Collections are growable in nature, allows both homogeneous and heterogeneous data elements, this have the readymade method support to work on different functionalities.

Differences between arrays and collections :

Collections are growable in nature based on our requirement.

collections concepts are not up to the mark based on performance wise

Differences 


               Arrays                                                           Collections
 1. Fixed in size                                                          1. Growable in nature.
 2.Arrays are not good for Memory management                               2.Collections are good for memory management.
 3.Performance wise this is good                                           3.Not good by performance wise.
 4.holds only homogeneous data                                             4.holds both homogeneous and heterogeneous data
 5.readymade method support is not available                               5. readymade methods are available(ex-to find the elemnts)
 6.Arrays can be used to store primitive and objects                       6.Collections store only objects
 
 
 Collection and Collection Framework--
 
 Collection is a group of individual objects represented as a single entity.
 
 What is collection framework ??
 
 It defines several classes and interfaces which are used to define a collection.
 
 Collection is not a new concept, it is alo there in other languages
 
 In java it is collection and in C++ it is Container
 
 Java- Collection framework and in C++ STL(Standard Template Library).[Library means a group of classes and interfaces].
 
 
 9 Key interfaces in Collection Framework --
 
 First Interface is collection
 
 1.Collection-defines the most common methods applicable for all the the collections like addd, isempty etc.
 2.In general collection interface is considered as the root interface for collection.
 
 Note : There is no concrete class that implements the collection interface directly.
 
 Diff between Collection and Collections :
 
 
Collection - interface, collections -class, this will have pre defined methods to work on collections

For example think of an arraylist we dont have any method to sort which means it is not defined in arraylist.

but we can use as Collections.sort(ArrayList) to sort it.

This is present in java.util.package.

Second Interface - List.(1.2)

1.duplicates are allowed.
2.Insertion order to be preserved.

Implementation classes of List are ArrayList(1.2), LinkedList(1.2), Vector[1.0] and Stack[1.0](Vector and stack are called as Legacy classes as they exist from 1.0) All others are from 1.2V(Collection, List,ArrayList,LinkedList)

The classes that exists from older versions are called as Legacy classes.

Third Interface is Set(1.2)

1.Duplicates are not allowed.
2.Insertion not preserved

Implementation classes Hashset(1.2V) and LinkedHashset(1.4V)


Diff between List and Set

List-0dupicates are allowed, Set-not allowed.
List-Insertion order preserved, Set-not preserved.

Fourth Interface -Sorted set(1.2V)

This is the child interface of Set(1.2V), when there is a requirement in which the duplicates are not allowed and insertion order need to be preserved then we go for Sortedset.

Fifth Interface -Navigable Set(1.6V)
It is the child interface of Sorted Set and it defines several navigation methods.

Implementation of the Navigable set is Treeset(1.2V)

Sixth Interface is Queue(1.5V)--

Implementation classes of Queue are Priority Queue(1.5V) and Blocking Queue(1.5V) and Blocking Queue have two more implementation classes

Linked Blocking Queue(1.5V) and Priority Blocking Queue(1.5V)

Note - All the above collection Interfaces are used to represent as group of  individual objects 

Queue is best used when we need to do any operation in First In First Out Order.

Before processing if we want to represent a group of individual objects, then we go for Queue.

For example consider a message to be sent for 100 people then the recepients should be stored in prior before sending then we can use

Queue interface.

If we want to represent a group of objects as Key value pairs then we got for Map Interface.

Seventh Interface -Map

Map is not the child interface of collections-

Omplementation classes

Map(1.2V)                                                                      HashTable comes from Dictionary.
|                         \                      \                       \      |
HashMap (1.2V)       WeakHashMap(1.2V)         IdentityHashMap(1.4V)       Hashtable
|                                                                              |
Linked HashMap(1.4V)                                                         child class of Hashtable is properties 


Dictionay HashTable and Properties classes are fom version 1.0 and so they are called as Legacy classes.


Eighth Interface Sorted Map(1.2V)


child interface of Map-

This is mainly used when we want to represent a group of objects as key value pairs according to some sorting order then we go for Sorted Map.


Ninth Interface -

Navigable Map(1.6V)--

child interface of sortedmap

It defines several utility methods for navigation purpose.Implementation of navigable map is tree map(1.2V)

Overview of collection framework

What is the difference between comparable and comparator?

Comparable meant for default sorting order.

Comparator meant for customised sorting order.

To get the collection objects one by one we have some interfaces.

Cursors is the concept.

How many cursors are there in java?

Enumeration
Iterator
ListIterator

All the above are used to get the collection objects one by one.

Utility classes-

1.Collections -defines serveral utility methods for collection object.
2.Arrays - defines several utility methods for Arrays object.

Collection framework-Collection Interface

In the collection interface we will have the most common methods applicable for any collection object.

add(Object o) -this is used whenever we need to add an object from the collection.
addAll(Collection c) - this is used to add the group of objects from the collection.
remove(Object o) - this is used whenever we need to remove an object from the collection.
removeAll(Collection c)-this is used to remove the group of objects from the collection.
clear() - to remove the entire objects in collection.
retailAll(Collection c)-Except a group of objects all the other objects are to be removed then we should use retainAll() method.

To check whether the collection is empty or not then we should use isEmpty().
To get the size of the collection - size().
To check whether a particular object is available or not in that collection - contains(Object o).
To check whether a group of particular objects are available or not -containsAll(Collection c).

Coverting a collection to array().

Object a[] =c.toArray().

To iterate all the objects in the collection use Iterator which returns the iterator object.

âœ”Collection interface doen't contain any method to retrieve objects as ther is no concrete class which implements the colletion class directly.

List Interface-

List is child interface of collection.
index play an important role in List.

Index -used to differentiate the duplicates and to preserve the insertion order.

methods specific to list interface.

To add an element at particular index- add(int index, Object o)
To add group of objects from a specified index addAll(int index Collection c)
To remove an element at a particular index- remove(int index)
To find a particular element in the list.indexOf(Object o)
To find the last occurence of that particular element in the lsit-list.lastIndexOf(Object o)
To iterate the list we use ListIterator()

To get the value at particular index get(int index)
To replace the element at the specified index- set(int index, Object o).

From the above we can notice that list interface have its own methods in addition to the methods that are getting from the collection.

Index play very important role in list interface.
  
Implementation classes of List--

ArrayList-

Main features of ArrayList--
->underlying data structure for arraylist - resizable or growable array.
->insertion order is preserved.
->duplicates are allowed.
->heterogeneous objects are allowed.
-> null insertion is also allowed.


heterogeneous objects are allowed in collection except in Treeset and TreeMap-this is because in this collection classes the objects are stored in sorting order.
also, to sort any object, the other should be of same type.hencce heterogeneous objects are not allowed in treeset and treemap.


Constructors-

1.ArrayList al = new ArrayList();\

whenever we create a arraylist its default capacity is 10.
but if we add 11th element then the compiler will create the new capacity arraylist by copying all the elements from the initially created arraylist and the old arraylist will be moved to garbage collection.

coming to the size of newly created arraylist- capacity is calculated as - current (capacity *3/2)+1

2.ArrayList al = ne ArrayList(int initialcapacity)

with the first constructor, if the sixe increases based on requirement the processing will be too lsow, since all the elements have to be copied to the newly created list.

but  if we know the capacity in prior then we can use this second constructor with initial capacity.

3.if we want to convert any collection object to arraylist then we can use this.

ArrayList al = new ArrayList(Collection c)


purpose of collection- to hold the objects and transfer the objects accross the network.
first to transfer the object it must be serialized, so every collection class by default use serializable interface.
onnce after sending the object the reciever takes it and creates an exact copy of the object - which is called cloning because if anything happens to the recieved object then it cannot be regained.so cloning is must.

hence every collection class implements cloneable interface.
